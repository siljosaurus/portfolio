            <p>Oftentimes, when we are first starting out we compare our beginnings to somebody that has been doing what you are trying to do for, like, 20 years. We look at what we did, maybe it was the first time writing a song, or painting a painting. And you look at it, being like “this looks like shit!”. And obviously, you’re going to feel like you’re not as good. Because, naturally, they have more experience than you. Thats why they say comparison is the thief of joy. You are in your own lane, remember that. You shouldn’t compare yourself to anyone else, you are making a difference in the world by being yourself.

                <br /> Treat everybody as if they are rooting for you. That is how you kill the ego.<br />
                <br /> Kill the ego.<br />

                <br /> Sort of like, when you make cookies for somebody. And you give them a cookie, and if they didn’t like the cookie, you’d be like “oh well”, fuck there must be something, maybe I got the measurements off this time or something. But they’d still be happy that you gave them a cookie. And also, you’d be like, “fuck it”, I can just go back and make another batch.  And it sort of is the same thing when you are creating, why does this song have to be like the best song that you’ve ever made in your whole life. Why can’t you make a fucking batch of bad songs. Like why can’t we do that? And then go back and maybe you’ll make a good one. Why can’t we treat design like we do baking?

                Why does it all have to be so important and serious, every single time? Why can’t we make a few things that are maybe not exactly how we wanted, but at least we tried?
